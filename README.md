This repository contains a Python implementation of a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**, a generative model that learns to encode and decode data into a latent space. The implementation is designed to be simple, modular, and easy to understand, making it a great resource for learning about VAEs or for use in your own projects.

## Introduction
A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of generative model that combines ideas from deep learning and probabilistic graphical models. It consists of an encoder network that maps input data to a latent space and a decoder network that reconstructs the data from the latent space. VAEs are widely used for tasks such as image generation, anomaly detection, and data compression.

### Latent Space Visualization

This implementation provides:
- A clean and modular codebase.
- An automated process to tune the parameters using MLFlow.
- Full implementation using Tensorflow.
- Visualization tools to explore the latent space and generated samples.

## Features
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable for different datasets and architectures.
- **Latent Space Visualization**: Tools to visualize the learned latent space.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Download and use pre-trained models for quick results.
- **Customizable**: Hyperparameters and network architectures can be easily modified.
